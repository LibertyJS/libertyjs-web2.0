As Organizers, we want to openly address and respond to an attendee’s effort to target and harass members of our community.

While we’ve been unable to track down the individual responsible, let us be clear that they are not welcome back at LibertyJS due to violations of our code of conduct.  We continue to look for solutions and if you have any information that may help us, we ask that you please come forward.

We welcome all to our community and treat each person with respect.  If you are not capable of doing that in return, this is not the right space for you.

Someone’s existence doesn’t cease because of your opinion.

To members of our community that were impacted by this issue, we sincerely apologize for this individual’s actions.  A variety of perspectives requires diversity of people and it is the strength of Philadelphia and of our technology community.

We will continue to work with leaders in various diversity spaces to ensure that we do everything we can for all of our attendees to feel respected, welcomed, and safe.

Thank you,

2019 LibertyJS Organizing Committee
